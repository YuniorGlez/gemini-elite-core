# Task Plan: Skill Refactoring and Optimization

## Goal
Establish a high-standard strategy for creating powerful skills and refactor all existing project skills to meet this standard, incorporating updated documentation and real-world examples.

## Phases
- [x] Phase 1: Research and Analysis
    - [x] Explore https://github.com/mgd34msu/goodvibes-plugin/tree/main to identify skill structure patterns.
    - [x] Analyze local skills in `skills/` to identify weaknesses and brevity.
- [x] Phase 2: Strategy Definition
    - [x] Create `SKILL_OPTIMIZATION_STRATEGY.md` with mandatory rules and tactics.
- [x] Phase 3: Audit and Roadmap
    - [x] Create `SKILL_REFACTOR_TODO.md` with a detailed list of tasks for each local skill.
- [x] Phase 4: Refactoring Execution (Iterative per Skill)
    - [x] **Step 4.1-4.32:** Refactored all original 41 skills to 2026 Standards.
    - [x] **Step 4.33:** Create `php-modern` skill (PHP 8.5/8.6).
    - [x] **Step 4.34:** Create `laravel-pro` skill (Laravel 13).
    - [x] **Step 4.35:** Create `filament-pro` skill (Filament v4).
    - [x] **Step 4.36:** Create `genai-expert` skill (@google/genai v1.35).
    - [x] **Step 4.37:** Create `react-native-pro` skill (RN 0.78).
    - [x] **Step 4.38:** Create `expo-expert` skill (SDK 55).
    - [x] **Step 4.39: Final Quality Audit & Project Handover**.

## Key Questions
1. What specific structural elements make the reference repository's skills superior?
2. Which local skills are the most outdated or critically brief?
3. What is the latest documentation for the key libraries (Next.js 16, React 19, etc.) mentioned in the skills?

## Status
**🚀 All Skills (Original + New) Refactored to 2026 Standard of Excellence.**
