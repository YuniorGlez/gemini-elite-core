---

## 🚨 Executive Summary - Critical Impacts

This release marks a major milestone in transitioning experimental features to stable, specifically affecting how **Skills** and **Extensions** are managed.

### 🔴 Critical Changes for Gemini Elite Core

1.  **Skills Settings Promotion**:
    *   **Before**: `experimental.skills: true`
    *   **After**: `skills.enabled: true` (Top-level)
    *   **Action**: `setup.sh` and `setup.cmd` have been updated to migrate existing configurations automatically.

2.  **Strict Policy Permissions**:
    *   **Rule**: `~/.gemini/policies` must be `700` and files must be `600`.
    *   **Impact**: Agents may fail to load planning policies if permissions are too loose.
    *   **Action**: Setup scripts now enforce these permissions automatically.

3.  **Enforced MCP Server Prefixes**:
    *   **Requirement**: All tools in agent definitions must have a server prefix (e.g., `filesystem:read_file`).
    *   **Action**: Future agent definitions in this core must use the prefixed format.

4.  **Extension Settings Integration**:
    *   **New Feature**: The CLI now automatically loads `hooks.json`, `agents.json`, and `skills.json` from extension directories.
    *   **Impact**: Modularizes core features, allowing for cleaner extension development.

5.  **Event-Driven Scheduler Migration**:
    *   **Improvement**: Non-interactive flows now use the event-driven scheduler, reducing agent latency significantly.

## 📈 Technical Recommendations

1.  **Plan First**: Always use `/plan` or `Shift+Tab`. V0.27 has optimized persistent storage for these plans.
2.  **Selective MCP**: When creating extensions, use the new `mcp` array in `extension.json` to allow users to selectively enable/disable specific servers.
3.  **Temporary Directory Access**: Leverage the new centralized path validation which allows tools safe access to the system temp directory.
