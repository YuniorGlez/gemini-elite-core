# Agentic Milestones and KPIs (2026)

Milestones in the AI era are defined by verifiable technical signals, not just dates.

## 1. Verifiable Milestones

A milestone is reached when:
-   **Criteria 1**: The implementation matches the `spec.md` exactly.
-   **Criteria 2**: 100% of the newly added types are verified by `tsc`.
-   **Criteria 3**: 80%+ test coverage is achieved for the new logic.

## 2. KPIs for AI Agents

Measure the effectiveness of your agent swarm:
-   **Hallucination Rate**: How many tool calls return an "API Not Found" error.
-   **Self-Correction Rate**: How often an agent fixes its own error without human intervention.
-   **Token efficiency**: Business value delivered per 1,000 tokens.

## 3. The "Definition of Done" (DoD)

Every mission track in Conductor must include a DoD block:
```markdown
### DoD
- [ ] PR merged to main.
- [ ] Documentation updated in `docs/`.
- [ ] Post-mortem saved in long-term memory.
```

## 4. Velocity vs. Quality Trade-offs

-   **Standard**: High-velocity modes (Flash) for scaffolding; high-fidelity modes (Pro/o3) for final validation.
-   *Metric*: "Refactor count" (number of times code had to be rewritten to meet standards).

## 5. Stakeholder Transparency

Provide an "Agentic Diary" summarizing the reasoning behind every major pivot in the project.
