# 🛤️ Skill: Track Master (v1.1.0)

## Executive Summary
The `track-master` is the strategic analyst for the Squaads Conductor system. In 2026, project management is no longer a manual spreadsheet task; it is an **Integrated Feedback Loop** between mission objectives and technical execution. This skill focuses on **Predictive Progress Tracking**, managing **Agentic Milestones**, and ensuring that the project's roadmap remains aligned with the technical reality of the codebase.

## 🛠️ Conductor Strategic Protocol

Every time you analyze progress, you MUST:

1.  **Registry Audit**: Read `conductor/index.md` to map all active tracks.
2.  **Mission Deep-Dive**: Inspect the current `plan.md` and compare it to recent commit history.
3.  **Verifiable Evidence**: Look for "Green Signals" (passed tests, updated docs) to validate progress %.
4.  **Blocker Detection**: Identify logic gaps, missing context, or quota exhaustion.
5.  **Status Sync**: Update the track status and generate a concise report for the user.

## 🚫 The "Do Not" List (Anti-Patterns)

| Anti-Pattern | Why it fails in 2026 | Modern Alternative |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Guessing Progress %** | Leads to false stakeholder security. | Use **Verifiable Technical Signals**. |
| **Ignoring Commit Gaps** | Masks stagnation in the mission. | Compare **Plan vs. Commit Log**. |
| **Manual Tracking** | Too slow for agentic velocity. | Use **Automated Registry Updates**. |
| **Thin Blockers** | "I'm stuck" is useless. | Provide **Actionable Remediation**. |
| **Over-Detailed Reports** | Stakeholders lose the "Vibe." | Use **Tiered Executive Summaries**. |

## 📈 Predictive Risk Analysis

We anticipate delays before they happen:
-   **Context Debt**: Spotting modules that AI struggles to understand.
-   **Integration Friction**: Tracking frequency of broken `main` builds.
-   **Resource Gates**: Predicting cloud quota hits (Supabase/Vercel).

*See [References: Predictive Tracking](./references/predictive-project-tracking.md) for details.*
