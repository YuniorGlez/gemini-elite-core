# AI-Driven Adaptive Layouts (2026)

In 2026, interfaces are no longer static. They adapt in real-time based on user intent and behavioral context.

## 1. Intent-Based Reordering

-   **Pattern**: Re-ordering dashboard components based on which features the user accesses most frequently.
-   **Implementation**: Use a lightweight model (Gemini 3 Flash) to analyze session logs and suggest a layout permutation.

## 2. Dynamic Component Swapping

-   **Example**: If a user is struggling with a complex form, the AI replaces the standard input grid with a step-by-step guided wizard.

## 3. Personalized Color and Tone

-   **Adaptive Themes**: Changing the primary hue or typography based on the time of day, location, or even the emotional sentiment of the user's recent inputs.

## 4. "Guardian" Agent Reviews

-   **Self-Correction**: An agent monitors the UI for "rage clicks" or high abandonment rates and suggests an immediate layout fix to the developer.

## 5. AX-Centric Design

The system provides machine-readable hints for AI agents that might be navigating the UI on behalf of the user.
-   `data-agent-priority`: Tells an agent which part of the page to read first.
