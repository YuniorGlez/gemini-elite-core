# Inclusive Design Patterns (2026)

Inclusive design goes beyond compliance to ensure that everyone, regardless of situation or ability, can use the product effectively.

## 1. Multiple Methods of Success

Provide different ways for users to achieve a goal.
-   **Example**: Allowing users to search via text, voice, or visual selection.

## 2. Error Forgiveness

Design systems that are tolerant of user mistakes.
-   **Action**: Provide "Undo" options for destructive actions.
-   **Action**: Clear, non-judgmental error messages that suggest a path forward.

## 3. Cognitive Accessibility

-   **Plain Language**: Avoid unnecessary jargon.
-   **Consistent UI**: Keep interactive elements in predictable locations.
-   **Focus Mode**: Allow users to hide non-essential UI elements during deep tasks.

## 4. Dark/Light Mode Parity

Ensure that neither mode feels like an afterthought.
-   **Verification**: Check contrast and visual hierarchy in both modes.
-   **Standard**: Use CSS variables or Tailwind theme tokens for consistent switching.

## 5. Situationally Inclusive Design

Consider users in temporary or situational disabilities:
-   **Example**: A user with a broken arm (Keyboard-only navigation).
-   **Example**: A user in a noisy environment (Mandatory captions for video).
-   **Example**: A user in bright sunlight (High-contrast mode).
