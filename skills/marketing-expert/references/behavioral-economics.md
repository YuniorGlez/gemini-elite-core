# Behavioral Economics for CRO

## Core Principles
Behavioral economics studies why people make "irrational" decisions. By understanding these patterns, we can design better user experiences.

### 1. Loss Aversion
The pain of losing is twice as powerful as the joy of gaining.
- **Application**: "Don't lose your 20% discount" is more effective than "Get a 20% discount."
- **Elite Pattern**: Use "Reserved for you" counters (ethical scarcity) to trigger the fear of missing out on a specific item.

### 2. Anchoring
People rely heavily on the first piece of information offered (the "anchor").
- **Application**: Show the original price (crossed out) next to the sale price.
- **Elite Pattern**: Present a "Pro" plan as the middle option, anchored by a very expensive "Enterprise" plan and a basic "Starter" plan.

### 3. Social Proof
People look to others to determine correct behavior.
- **Application**: "Join 10,000+ developers."
- **Elite Pattern**: Use specific, data-rich testimonials. "Company X increased revenue by 14% using this tool" > "Great tool!"

### 4. The Paradox of Choice
Too many options lead to decision paralysis.
- **Application**: Limit the number of products on a single screen.
- **Elite Pattern**: Use "Recommended for you" tags to guide the user to a single, optimal choice.

### 5. Framing Effect
How information is presented affects the decision.
- **Application**: "90% fat-free" sounds better than "10% fat."
- **Elite Pattern**: Frame your product's price in terms of "Cost per day" vs "Total annual cost."
