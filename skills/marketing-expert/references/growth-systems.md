# Growth Hacking Systems

## High-Tempo Testing (HTT)
Growth is not about "one big hack," but 100 small experiments every month.

### The HTT Process:
1. **Ideate**: Generate 50+ ideas for growth.
2. **Prioritize (ICE Score)**:
   - **I**mpact: How much will this help?
   - **C**onfidence: How sure are we it will work?
   - **E**ase: How easy is it to implement?
3. **Execute**: Run the top 3-5 experiments.
4. **Analyze**: Measure the results and discard failures.
5. **Scale**: Double down on the winners.

## Viral Loops
A product that grows itself is the ultimate goal.

### 1. The Invitation Loop
"Invite a friend and get $10." 
- **2026 Evolution**: Give the friend the value first (e.g., "Give your friend a free Pro account for a month").

### 2. The Content Loop
Users create content that is indexed by search engines or shared on social media (e.g., Pinterest, Medium, GitHub).

## Retention-First Growth
Acquiring a new customer is 5-10x more expensive than retaining an existing one.

- **The "Aha!" Moment**: Identify the exact moment a user realizes the value of your product (e.g., for Slack, it's sending 2,000 messages). Optimize the entire onboarding to reach this moment as fast as possible.

## Referral Engineering
Make it socially rewarding to share.
- **Example**: "Powered by [Your Tool]" in the footer of free accounts.
- **Example**: Shareable "Achievement Cards" or "Stats Summaries" (e.g., Spotify Wrapped).
