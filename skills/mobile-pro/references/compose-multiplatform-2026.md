# Compose Multiplatform: Native Quality Everywhere (2026)

Compose Multiplatform has achieved full feature parity across Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web.

## 1. Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) Integration

Compose Multiplatform uses KMP to share business logic while providing native-quality UI.

-   **Shared UI**: Write the UI once in Kotlin and run it everywhere.
-   **Native Interop**: Use `expect/actual` to access platform-specific APIs (e.g., Apple Pay, Android Sensors).

## 2. iOS First-Class Treatment

In 2026, Compose code feels native on Apple devices.
-   **Swift Interop**: Call Kotlin UI from Swift and vice versa seamlessly.
-   **Native Gestures**: Support for iOS-specific "Rubber-banding" and haptic feedback.

## 3. Revolutionary Performance

-   **Pausable Composition**: Split UI work over multiple frames.
-   **Predictive Recomposition**: Anticipate state changes to minimize frame drops.

## 4. AI-Assisted UI Generation

Compose now supports direct integration with AI tools for:
-   **Natural Language to UI**: Generate complex screens from a text description.
-   **Intelligent Optimization**: Automatically refactors UI code for maximum performance.

## 5. Ecosystem Stack

-   **Networking**: Ktor.
-   **Serialization**: Kotlinx Serialization.
-   **Database**: SQLDelight (SQLite).
-   **Image Loading**: Coil Multiplatform.
